This directory contains the source code for the 
CCITT G.722 standard speech compression/decompression
algorithm. The code was originally written by Milton Anderson
(milton@thumper.bellcore.com) from BELLCORE, and has
been modified by Chengxiang Lu and Alex Hauptmann from the Speech Group, 
Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University to be fairly fast 
and efficient, while retaining high fidelity. 

decoder.c contains all the code to decompress an encoded file.
Usage: adpcm_decoder  < adpcm_file > pcm_file

encoder.c contains all the code to compress a raw speech file 
Usage: adpcm_coder < pcm_file > adpcm_file

sample test files are provided:

pcminb.dat (raw speech data, PCM, 16khz, 16 bit (signed)).

Read the file adpcm.tex or adpcm.ps for more information.

If you have questions, please contact Alex Hauptmann (alex@cs.cmu.edu)
or Chengxiang Lu (lu+@cs.cmu.edu).
