What is MAST ?
--------------

MAST is an audio streaming broadcaster and client using RTP over IPv4 and IPv6 Multicast/Unicast.

Unlike VAT and RAT, which are designed primerily for audio conferencing, MAST
is designed to be used for audio distribution and broadcast. It is currently limited 
to recieving a single audio source, unlike RAT which can mix serveral sources.

It supports many of the audio payload types in the Audio-visual Profile (RTP/AVP).

MAST is licenced under the GNU General Public License, see the file COPYING for details.



Current Limitations
-------------------

- No mixer support (can only recieve single source)
- No sample rate conversion support
- No upmixing/downmixing support
- No clock skew error correction
- mast_rawcast currently only supports GSM and MPEG Audio
- due to problems with oRTP, only 8000Hz streams can be recieved



Tools in MAST
-------------

mast_info		Display information about first packet received
mast_cast		Live Audio Broadcaster <- Jack
mast_filecast	Audio file broadcaster
mast_rawcast	Directly broadcast a previously encoded audio file
mast_record		Record/archive audio stream to audio file

Setting up SDL audio output
---------------------------

SDL's audio output settings can be configured by setting environment variables.

You can choose the audio driver and sound card in this way.
