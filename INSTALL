Installation of MAST
====================
Nicholas J. Humfrey <njh@ecs.soton.ac.uk>

MAST uses autoconf, so should work on most POSIX systems.


Quick Start
-----------

 ./configure
 make


Then as root:

 make install


IPv6 Multicast on Linux
-----------------------

I have problems with IPv6 multicast on Linux kernels newer 
than 2.4.18 (including 2.6.3). I do not understand the details
but it seems to relate to falling back from MLDv2 to MLDv1.

Requirements
------------

Most of the requirments are optional,
configure will add features depending on the
libraries available on your system.

mastclient requires either SDL/Jack/OSS for audio playback.
