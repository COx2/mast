.TH "PCM6SHOUT.CONF" "5" "19 May 2004" "" ""

.SH NAME
pcm6shout.conf \- configuration file for pcm6shout(1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The configuration file is the only way to pass options and settings
to pcm6shout(1). This man page describes all the available options
and where applicable, their default values. The configuration file
maybe be located anywhere on the file system and the filename does
not need to be pcm6shout.conf.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The format of the pcm6shout configuration file is very simple. There is one
configuration option per line in the file. Each option is formatted as
option's name, followed by a space, followed by the option's value.
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash (#) are ignored. The maximum
length of a single line is 255 characters. Each configuration option
should only appear once.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBmulticast_ip\fR
The address of the IPv6 multicast group to receive packets on.
There is no default value for this option.
.TP
\fBmulticast_port\fR
The port to receive packets on. Should be an even number. RTCP
reports are sent on one port higher. Port numbers above 1024 are
usually used. There is no default value for this option.
.TP
\fBmulticast_ttl\fR
The TTL for RTCP report packets. Default value is 127.
.TP
\fBmulticast_timeout\fR
The time in seconds to wait for a packet. Set to 0 to disable
timeouts. Default is to wait 10 seconds.
.TP
\fBmulticast_ssrc\fR
Only accept packets from this SSRC, expressed as a hexadecimal number.
Default is to accept packets from the SSRC of the first packet received.
.TP
\fBaudio_format\fR
Either "\fBMP3\fR" or "\fBVorbis\fR". Chooses the format that the audio is
encoded to. Default format is MP3.
.TP
\fBmp3_bitrate\fR
The \fBbitrate\fR of the encoded MP3 in \fBkbps\fR\&. Default bitrate is 128.
See lame --longhelp for a list of valid bitrates.
.TP
\fBmp3_mode\fR
Either "\fBMono\fR", "\fBJoint\fR" or "\fBStereo\fR". Joint will encode the difference
between the two channels, which will result in better quality audio
if the two channels are similar. Default mode is Joint.
.TP
\fBmp3_quality\fR
True quality is determined by the bitrate but this variable will effect
quality by selecting expensive or cheap algorithms.
Quality is an integer between 0 and 9. Default quality is 3.
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB0\fR   best quality, very slow
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB2\fR   near-best quality, not too slow
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB5\fR   good quality, fast
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB7\fR   ok quality, really fast
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB9\fR   worst quality, very fast
.RE
.TP
\fBvorbis_quality\fR
The \fBquality\fR of the Ogg Vorbis stream is chosen using a
floating point number between 0 and 10.
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB0.0\fR  is lowest quality, least bandwidth.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB4.0\fR  is default (about 128 kbps VBR).
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fB10.0\fR is highest quality, most bandwidth.
.RE
.TP
\fBvorbis_downmix\fR
\fBTrue\fR or \fBFalse\fR\&. Downmix a stereo source stream to mono before
encoding to Ogg Vorbis. Default is to not downmix.
.TP
\fBshout_host\fR
The \fBIP address\fR or \fBhostname\fR of the Icecast/Shoutcast server to connect to.
Default host is localhost.
.TP
\fBshout_port\fR
The port of the Icecast/Shoutcast server. Default is port 8000.
.TP
\fBshout_protocol\fR
The \fBprotocol\fR to use for communicating with the server. Use "\fBhttp\fR" for
an Icecast 2 Server, "\fBshoutcast\fR" for a Shoutcast server, or "\fBaudiocast\fR"
for an Icecast 1 Server. Default protocol is http.
.TP
\fBshout_password\fR
The \fBsource password\fR for connecting to the server.
There is no default password.
.TP
\fBshout_username\fR
Optional username for the server. Default username is "source".
.TP
\fBshoutispublic\fR
\fBTrue\fR or \fBFalse\fR\&. Should this stream be advertised on public directories ?
Default is not to be public.
.TP
\fBshout_name\fR
The \fBname\fR of the stream. Default is "Unconfigured pcm6shout stream".
.TP
\fBshout_genre\fR
The audio \fBgenre\fR of the stream. Default is no genre.
.TP
\fBshout_url\fR
A \fBURL\fR for users to find out more information about the stream.
Default is no URL.
.TP
\fBshout_description\fR
A textual \fBdescription\fR about the content of the stream.
Default is no description.
.TP
\fBshout_mount\fR
Mountpoint for Icecast servers. This allows you to server more than one
audio stream with a streaming server. For example "/stream_low.ogg".
Default is to use the default mount (/).
.TP
\fBshout_dumpfile\fR
The filename for archives of the stream to be recorded remotely on
the server. Default is not to have a dump file.
