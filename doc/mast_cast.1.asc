NAME
----
mast_cast - Live Audio broadcaster that sources audio from JACK

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_cast' [options] <address>[/<port>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_cast(1) recieves audio from a JACK live audio source, encodes the audio and 
sends it out encapsulated in an RTP packet. The port number should be an even 
number (RTCP reports are sent one port higher). If no port number is specified, 
then the default RTP port number (5004) is used.


OPTIONS
-------
-h::
	Return usage and version information.

-t <ttl>::
	Sets 'TTL' (Time To Live) for packets sent. Packets will ignored after
	they have passed this number of routers. Default is 5, maximum is 127.

-p <payload>::
	'Payload type' of the encoded packets. mast_cast currently only supports
	the following four static payload types. Default is 'L16'.
	- 'PCMU'    8khz     Mono
	- 'PCMA'    8khz     Mono
	- 'L16'     44.1khz  Mono or Stereo
		
-z <size>::
	'Payload size' of the packets. Allows you to choose the length of the payload
	data (in bytes) for each packet transmitted. This is usually a number between
	300 bytes and 1300 bytes. This isn't normally required - a payload size
	will be selected based on the chosen payload type. 
	Note that the maximum packet size (MTU) is determined by your networking equipment.
	Also be careful of IP-in-IP tunnelling as packets will have two IP headers which
	makes it more likely that the packet will be too big and get fragmented.
		
-s <ssrc>::
	By default a random SSRC is generated, however if you want to ensure that an SSRC
	remain constant between invocations of the program, then you may specify it here as 
	a hexadecimal number.
	
-d <dcsp>::
	DCSP Quality of Service value

-r <msec>::
	JACK Ringbuffer duration in milliseconds

-c <channels>::
	Number of input channels (default 2)

-n <name>::
	The name of the JACK client

-a::
	Auto-connect the JACK input ports to the first two output ports it finds.


EXAMPLES
--------

`mast_cast -c 2 -p L16 152.78.64.103`

Send stereo, uncompressed 44.1kHz audio to the IP address 152.78.64.103.


`mast_cast -c 1 -a -p PCMU -s 0x4692CA65 233.122.222.1/1234`

Send a mono audio stream, compressed using G.711 to a multicast group, with port 1234.
The JACK input ports will automatically be connected to the first two output ports it finds.
