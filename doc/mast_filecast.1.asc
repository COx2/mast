NAME
----
mast_cast - Live Audio broadcaster that sources audio from JACK

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mast_cast' [options] <address>[/<port>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
mast_cast(1) recieves audio from a JACK live audio source, encodes the audio and 
sends it out encapsulated in an RTP packet. The port number should be an even 
number (RTCP reports are sent one port higher). If no port number is specified, 
then the default RTP port number (5004) is used.


OPTIONS
-------
-h::
	Return usage and version information.

-t::
	Sets 'TTL' (Time To Live) for packets sent. Packets will ignored after
	they have passed this number of routers. Default is 5, maximum is 127.

-p::
	'Payload type' of the encoded packets. mast_cast currently only supports
	the following four static payload types. Default is 'L16'.
	- 'PCMU'    8khz     Mono
	- 'PCMA'    8khz     Mono
	- 'L16'     44.1khz  Mono or Stereo
		
-z::
	'Payload size' of the packets. Allows you to choose the length of the payload
	data (in bytes) for each packet transmitted. This is usually a number between
	300 bytes and 1300 bytes. This isn't normally required - a payload size
	will be selected based on the chosen payload type. 
	Note that the maximum packet size (MTU) is determined by your networking equipment.
	Also be careful of IP-in-IP tunnelling as packets will have two IP headers which
	makes it more likely that the packet will be too big and get fragmented.
	
-f::
	Use audio file 'filename' as the source of the audio to be multicast.
	Audio file format can be AIFF/WAVE/.snd/.au. The sample rate and number of
	channels should be the same as the chosen payload type. The encoding of the 
	samples should be 16-bit twos complement.
	
-l::
	'Loop' the audio file. Repeat playing the audio file. Only valid with '-f'.

-d::
	Use sound card 'device' as source of audio. Your operating system must
	support the OSS (basic) API.
		
-i::
	Use 'STDIN' as source of audio. Audio must be the same sample rate and number
	of channels as the chosen payload type. The sample format should be 16-bit 
	two's complement and using the system endianess.

-s::
	Usually a random SSRC is generated, however if you want to ensure that an SSRC
	remain constant between invocations of the program, then you may specify it here as 
	a hexadecimal number.

EXAMPLES
--------

`mast_cast -f audiofile.aiff FF03::123/5010`

Broadcast a sound file out to multicast group FF02::123 on port 5010.

`mast_cast -d /dev/dsp -p 8 FF03::123/5010`

Broadcast audio from sound card using payload type 8.

BUGS
----
- mast_cast(1) does not currently use RTCP (it should)
