NAME
----
pcm6shout - encode and send a multicast raw audio stream to an 
icecast/shoutcast server

SYNOPSIS
--------
'pcm6shout' pcm6shout.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
pcm6shout(1) receives an audio RTP stream and encodes it to either
MPEG audio or Ogg Vorbis. It is then sent to an icecast/shoutcast
server using libshout.

pcm6shout(1) is setup using a configuration file and the only
option it takes on the command line is the name of the file to load
its configuration from. See pcm6shout.conf(5) for details of the format
of the configuration file.

NOTE: libmp3lame is needed to encode to MP3 and libogg and libvorbis
is needed to encode to Ogg Vorbis.
