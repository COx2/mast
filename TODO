Use POD instead of asciidoc for documentation.

Finish convertion from pcm6cast to MAST.
	- ipv4 examples
	- merge in new multicast socket code

Only try to rebuild documentation if tools are available

Re-simplify the client (we only have one client again now - no mastshout)

Add JACK support
	- see jack.udp source code (sw-23)

Add support for direct playout using OSS

Make fink+Debian packages



Change sources if one drops out

Abort after timeout if no valid packets have been received

Choice of scheme for packet loss recovery
 - None
 - Silence
 - Repeat


** Add RTCP Support **

Add session announement use SAP
Simple SAP client too ?


Have a small / simple packet buffer to re-order minor packet ordering problems
 - I implemented a simple version of this 
   There seems to be far more lost packets, than out of order ones
   so I removed the 'hacked in' support for this

Check for duplicated packets and verify timestamps

Fix timing problems in mastcast which are causing Jitter problems
 - Looked at this and can't see a better solution ?
 - Timing is almost exactly the same as rat when broadcasting from sound card

Allow client to only play from specified SRC IP
 - and remove the SSRC selecting code ?

Display Current Play state info with \r

Allow choice of interface for Multicast

Perl script to open SDP files using mastclient
