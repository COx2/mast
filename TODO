MAST To-Do list
===============



- New tools
  * mast_reflect - UDP Packet Refelector
  * mast_listen - Client / Listener -> Jack
  * mast_meter - automatically connect mast_listen to jack_meter
  * mast_clockcast - Multicast Talking Clock
  * mast_transcast  Reflect and transcode RTP streams


- Support streaming of multiple files in mast_filecast and mast_rawcast
- Support multiple frames per packet in mast_rawcast

- Support for taking HTTP stream as input using libcurl?

- Choose number of blocks/units per packet instead of maximum packet size?
  * Or choose the packet duration instead

- Add RTCP/SDES display of remote stream in recievers

- Built-in audio resampling (using Secret Rabbit Code)
  * use dynamic resampling to cope with unsynced clocks


- Seperate out more of the common code in each of the tools source files
  * Address / port parsing
  


- Properly implement change sources if one drops out?
  * option to not allow SSRC changes?

- Abort after timeout if no valid packets have been received

- Choice of scheme for packet loss recovery (does oRTP do this?)
  * None
  * Silence
  * Repeat



- Add SDP generation and RTSP announce support.
  * Or perhaps use SDP parser to use SDP files as config files?
- Add session announement using SAP
  * Simple SAP client too ?


- Use 32-bit floats for audio internally (instead of 16-bit ints)




Changes to make to oRTP
-----------------------

- Fix bug in oRTP that is causing problems recieving non-8000khz streams.
- Fix bug in oRTP that is causing 000000 RTCP message in RAT.
- Allow choice of interface for Multicast
