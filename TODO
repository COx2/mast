Finish convertion from pcm6cast to MAST.
	- ipv4 examples
	- merge in new multicast socket code

mast_transcast	Reflect and transcode RTP streams
mast_listen - Client / Listener -> Jack
mast_meter - automatically connect mast_listen to jack_meter
mast_clockcast - Multicast Talking Clock


Built-in audio resampling (using Secret Rabbit Code)


Seperate out some of the common code in each of the tools source files
	- Address / port parsing
	

JACK support
	- see jack.udp source code (sw-23)

Make fink+Debian packages

Change sources if one drops out?

Abort after timeout if no valid packets have been received

Support streaming of multiple files in mast_filecast and mast_rawcast

Choice of scheme for packet loss recovery (does oRTP do this?)
 - None
 - Silence
 - Repeat


Support multiple frames per packet in mast_rawcast
Support for taking shoutcast stream as input using CURL?

Add SDP generation and RTSP announce support.
Add session announement use SAP
Simple SAP client too ?
Or perhaps use SDP parser to use SDP files as config files?
Perl script to open SDP files using mast_listen?


Allow client to only play from specified SRC IP
 - and remove the SSRC selecting code ?

Display Current Play state info with \r

Allow choice of interface for Multicast

Use 32-bit floats for audio internally (instead of 16-bit ints)
